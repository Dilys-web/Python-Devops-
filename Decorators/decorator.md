Decorators are a versatile feature in Python that can help you write cleaner and more maintainable code by separating concerns and enhancing functionality. They are widely used in frameworks like Flask and Django for routing, middleware, and more.

Built-in Decorators
Python also has some built-in decorators, such as:

@staticmethod: Defines a static method in a class.
@classmethod: Defines a class method.
@property: Allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes.
